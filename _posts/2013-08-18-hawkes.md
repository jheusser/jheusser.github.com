# Introduction

Whats the point:
    Trade clustering is a reality, especially with bitcoin where theres a lot of bots which react
    to trades. This seems very evident for anyone following trading.

    In the finance world, especially for market making trade clustering is important phenomenon
    because you trade against the general consensus, so you want to know whether you will continue to 
    get matched against the general trader.

    If you have a way to model trade arrival then you can react to it, predict future trade imbalance few
    seconds ahead.

    Self-exciting processes are used to model clustering of events in time, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruoptions, trade arrival in finance, and also stuff like eruption of violence (link to iraqi death modelling).

    Plot clustering of trade arrivals for bitcoin using the example data

Used in seismology (earth quakes, volcanic eruptions), neuroscience (spike train modelling), violence eruptions


# Self-Exciting Processes

example plot using the python code and fake arrival times

explain self excitability and cross excitability as possibiltiy of bid/ask prices


# Application to Bitcoin tick data

show fitted and empirical intensities

goodness of fit using time change QQ plot to poisson process
